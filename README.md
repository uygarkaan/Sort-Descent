## Sort Descent

## Project Overview

The **Sort Descent** application is a simple Java program designed to sort three user-input integers in descending order. The program takes three integer inputs from the user and displays them in descending order based on their values.

## Features

- **User Input:** The program prompts the user to input three integers.
- **Sorting:** The program compares the three integers and arranges them in descending order.
- **Output:** The sorted integers are displayed in descending order.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of the key components in the code:

- **Variable Declarations:** Three integer variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) are used to store the user's input.
- **Input Gathering:** The program prompts the user to enter three integers.
- **Sorting Logic:** The program uses nested `if-else` statements to compare the integers and determine their order.
- **Output:** The integers are printed in descending order.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the program might work:

```bash
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 2
Enter the third number: 8

8 > 5 > 2
```
